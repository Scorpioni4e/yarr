Q: How can I resolve any doubt I have about YARR?
A: Ask me at olelen <at> gmail <dot> com.

Q: In which kernels have you tested YARR?
A: Right now the one I use to develop, 2.6.35 series.

Q: How I compile YARR?
A: First of all this is a LKM (Linux Kernel Module) so you need gcc, linux
   headers (or sources) and make utilities. Then just go to src/ folder and
   type "make". That should be enough but I'm aware that changing the system
   can cause problems. As an example, when you compile in Debian there are no
   problems, but if you tried the same on Ubuntu (with build-essential and all
   that stuff, of course) you will get problems with asmlinkage because there
   aren't included some headers files (linux/linkage.h if i remember) in some
   YARR files. If you get some nasty errors that don't know from where they
   come let it me know, I will try to help and solve those problems.

Q: How I use YARR?
A: You have to load it into the kernel (insmod, modprobe) and then you can
   communicate with it through its system call (yarrcall) or through its IRQ
   (yarrIntrDesc). I'm sorry but right now I don't have an easy way to do
   things. You have to program your own utilities to use YARR, and program
   them could be painfully (specially if you try to use the IRQ). Even though
   I have programmed some snippets that could help you to do so, they are at
   the tests/ folder. Again, if you have doubts contact me.

Q: Why did you start YARR?
A: Because programming is awesome and I also want to study the Linux kernel
   in-depth, and programming a rootkit let me do both things :). So it is just
   for fun.
